| Is your database already hosted in Azure? If not, then what are your plans to migrate your database to Azure? Do you have a requirement to migrate without downtime?| Determine the current migration strategy, and what requirements or limitations may exist.| [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cloud-migrate ][1]  |  
| Are you hosting your SQL databases on Azure using an Infrastructure as a Service approach? Are you planning to modernize onto Azure SQL DB?| Determine if there are plans to rearchitect the solution to use the Platform as a Service (PaaS) alternative, reducing the overall management overhead of the solution.| [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cloud-migrate][1]  |  
| What size is your database and how many databases are you planning to migrate?| Determine the appropriate migration paths, given the size and volume of databases to be migrated.|[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-import-export-service][2]<br><br>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-elastic-pool][3] |

| **Question**| **Purpose**| **Relevant Documentation**   |  
|---|---|---|  
| How do you monitor your data layer?|Determine whether there is any enterprise monitoring of the data layer. How is it determined that the solution is working appropriately? If this is not being used, consider the associated documentation.| [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-single-database-monitor][17]  |  
|How would you know if you had an outage or failure?| Monitoring may be configured, but how much is it used? Determine if a live issue would first be reported by end-users, or whether monitoring systems would pick this up in advance. This also leads towards DevOps, and having a representative environment prior to production, which has representative tests in place.|  |  
|What alerts have been set-up?| Does the monitoring system require an individual to take the initiative and review the details, or will it send proactive notifications such as e-mails?|  |

| **Azure SQL Server on IaaS** - Have you placed your virtual machines into an availability set?| To provide redundancy to your application, it is recommended that you group two or more virtual machines of the same tier in an availability set. This configuration within a datacenter ensures that during either a planned or unplanned maintenance event, at least one virtual machine is available and meets the 99.95% Azure SLA. | [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability)  |

|Is the data stored in your database sensitive? Do you require special data handling?| Identify the encryption and protection requirements of the solution. Leverage the associated documentation in providing a solution to this problem.|  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine][26]<br><br> [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-tde][27]<br><br>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/sql-server-encryption][28] |  
|Do you use a multi-tenant database structure?| Establish risks of cross user contamination of data. | [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/sql-server-encryption][28] |  
|Do you audit access to the servers and the DDL queries that are run?| Determine whether there is an understanding into which users are performing which tasks / queries / functoins?

|Who has admin access to the system?| This builds upon the previous question. Limiting admin access is a recommended practice. Admins can bypass security measures and potentially see protected data.|  |  
|Do you encrypt your backups?| Protecting data at rest may be important. Is there a guarantee that backed-up data cannot be restored to another server that is not under your control?| [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-tde][27]   |  
|Can you define the business impact for a data breach? |Determine whether there is an understanding into the follow-on effects of a data breach. Has the wider business impact been considered, rather than just focusing on the technology challenge and impact?|  |
